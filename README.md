## DataDuelPredictions

For the last three seasons I have been predicting Premier League scores on a game someone awesome I know created - [dataduel](https://dataduel.uk/)

Using this thing called machine learning I've been predicting (sometimes correctly) scores, all the code is [here](https://github.com/pratikthanki/PremierLeaguePredictions).

Getting more and more into .NET I wanted to try something different, I am using [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) which is cool! Not quite Tensorflow or scikit learn, though I know it will get there! 

If you think you have what it takes then sign-up and get predicting! It has an API too!
